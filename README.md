Folders: Each folder is labeled by first author, publication acronym, and year of publication. The folders contain Collaborative Publication Agreements filled out by each author on a publication.

The Collaborative Publication Agreement (AGREE_hs.md) template was designed to capture metadata, data and code provenance, contributors and funders for populating fields in the HydroShare Resource (www.hydroshare.org). We include definitions of basic collaboration components (e.g. author, contributor) as well as the following sections: Code of Conduct, Cultural Disclosure, and Author Expectations.

To contribute to this open-source project, please fork the repository, build your own templates and folders for publications, and Pull Request canaryopera to merge your contributions.
