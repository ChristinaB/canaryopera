This project was inspired by the introverts who would benefit from a package of words, and the extroverts who are too busy to listen.  

The decision to package and share an other-wise dull semi-formal non-binding agreesment came from the podcast episode [The workplace was not designed for moms](https://kuow.org/stories/this-was-once-kuow-s-lactation-room-here-s-why-that-s-not-ok) produced by the podcast [Battle Tactics for Your Sexist Workplace](https://kuow.org/podcasts/battle-tactics/), which is inspired by the book [Feminist Fight Club](https://www.feministfightclub.com/).  

Much thanks to the inspiring scientific community for their ongoing pursuit of transparency, ethical use of public funds, inclusion and diversity; especially the dedicated scientists, researchers, and software developers who spend their days thinking about topics like reproducibility, data provenance, persistent identifiers, and machine readable metadata.
