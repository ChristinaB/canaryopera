## 1.0 Introduction
In an effort to produce FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) research products, this guidance document (draft) is intended to communicate with collaborating team members, students, and sponsors.  Please use this as an onboarding/offboarding tool to facilitate an ongoing and improved collaboration process that results in peer reviewed publications and public communications.   This page is a work in progress which we hope to make available on the HydroShare, Help pages and CUAHSI website as a model of how to work as a group to develop ongoing contributions between multiple collaborative projects.   

## 2.0 Definitions 
These definitions are developed to describe the use of HydroShare metadata fields. 

### Authorship 

Following Clement (Clement), authors of HydroShare publications are asked to consider that... 

...the title “author ” is like the title “sculptor ” and such titles simply cannot be conferred on someone.[1,5] These titles can only be earned by an artist by creating a product. “Author ” is someone who goes on an intellectual journey full of twists and turns to create a unique product of his mind; he then shoulders the responsibility to produce a near perfect product. [5]   Potential coauthors who claim a share of this creative effort should ask themselves certain questions: Was I part of a significant stretch of this intellectual journey? Is this effort a near-perfect product of my mind? Can I shoulder some unique responsibilities and defend them? If the answers are yes then he or she should be a coauthor.

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to a publication include will list all authors using the HydroShare metadata fields.  Authors are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile.  Author order is determined based on the journal, research community practices, and preferences of the co-authors. Author order is controlled by the resource owners, and any user with Edit permissions to the resource. 

Author is defined in Dublin core. … reference 


#### Contributors

Contributors provide advice, suggestions, edits and invest time or resources to enhance the publication.  Contributors are not familiar with every aspect of the intellectual contributions in the work, nor are they implied as or held responsible for the standards, rigor, or quality of results presented in the publication.  

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to the publication will list all contributors using the HydroShare metadata fields.  Contributors are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile. 

#### Ownership of a HydroShare resource
Publications and related data may be published on HydroShare as part of the publication process.  This may include generating multiple resources with unique DOIs for contributing datasets or other research products that are outcomes of the work conducted while developing the publication.  Owners of HydroShare resources related to a publication, are responsible for the initiation, maintenance, and serve as the long-term contact that may be necessary to support use of the resource by HydroShare users and the public.  

Owners must be HydroShare users to create new resources. Owners are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile. Multiple owners are permitted. 

#### Funders
Funding should include all contributing contracts between all institutions supporting researchers and students contributing to the scope of work during and after the completion of the contracted project.
