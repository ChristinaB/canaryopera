## 1.0 Introduction

In an effort to produce FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reproducible) research products, this is intended to communicate with collaborating projects members (authors, contributors and sponsors).  Please use or edit this tool to facilitate an ongoing and improved collaboration process that results in peer reviewed publications and public communications.  Have you added Canary Opera to your Data Management Plan? Please add new repositories to https://github.com/canaryopera. Are you using this template for a publication? Fork the canaryopera repository, add a folder with your publication agreements, and Pull Request so we can add your version and data to the library. 

## 2.0 Definitions, Roles and Responsibilities
The following definitions are developed to describe the use of HydroShare metadata fields.  

### Authorship 
**Definition**

Author is defined in [Dublin core](http://dublincore.org/documents/1998/09/dces/) as "The person or organization primarily responsible for creating the intellectual content of the resource."

Following Clement (Clement), authors of HydroShare publications are asked to consider that... 

...the title “author ” is like the title “sculptor ” and such titles simply cannot be conferred on someone.[1,5] These titles can only be earned by an artist by creating a product. “Author ” is someone who goes on an intellectual journey full of twists and turns to create a unique product of his mind; he then shoulders the responsibility to produce a near perfect product. [5]   Potential coauthors who claim a share of this creative effort should ask themselves certain questions: Was I part of a significant stretch of this intellectual journey? Is this effort a near-perfect product of my mind? Can I shoulder some unique responsibilities and defend them? If the answers are yes then he or she should be a coauthor.

**Metadata**

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to this publication will list all authors using the HydroShare metadata fields.  Authors are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile.  Author order is determined based on the journal, research community practices, and preferences of the co-authors. Author order is controlled by the resource owners, and any user with Edit permissions to the resource. 

**List of authors and responsibilities**

Helen Deweese is responsible for the overall coordination and creation of the writing, code and data products. 

Christina Bandaragoda is responsible for contributing scientific ideas designed to reframe the existing case study in Santa Barbara into a advancement in geospatial interpolation designed with reproducible open source code.

Contributors are not familiar with every aspect of the intellectual contributions in the work, nor are they implied as or held responsible for the standards, rigor, or quality of results presented in the publication.  

**Metadata**

HydroShare resources used to publish data related to the publication will list all contributors using the HydroShare metadata fields.

**List of contributors and contributions**

### Ownership of a HydroShare resource
Publications and related data may be published on HydroShare as part of the publication process.  This may include generating multiple resources with unique DOIs for contributing datasets or other research products that are outcomes of the work conducted while developing the publication.  Owners of HydroShare resources related to a publication, are responsible for the initiation, maintenance, and serve as the long-term contact that may be necessary to support use of the resource by HydroShare users and the public.  

**Metadata**

Owners must be HydroShare users to create new resources. Owners are requested to become HydroShare users and complete the HydroShare profile. Multiple owners are permitted. 

### Funders
Funding should include all contributing contracts between all institutions supporting researchers and students contributing to the scope of work during and after the completion of the contracted project.  

## 3.0 Code of Conduct

By signing this agreement, you are committing to providing a harassment-free learning experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any virtual meeting, in person meeting, conference venue, or public talks. Collaborators violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the collaboration and inclusion in the publication. 

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion.

Sexual images in public spaces

Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following

Harassing photography or recording

Sustained disruption of talks or other events

Inappropriate physical contact

Unwelcome sexual attention

Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behaviour

Collaborators asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a collaborator engages in harassing behaviour, the lead author and supporting collaborators retain the right to take any actions to keep the collaboration a welcoming environment for all. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from collaboration.

## 4.0 Cultural Disclosure
